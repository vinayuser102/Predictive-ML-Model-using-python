```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`

## Usage
To use this notebook, clone the repository and open the `mylearn.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yellowgoku102/Predictive-ML-using-python.git
cd Predictive-ML-using-python
jupyter notebook mylearn.ipynb
```

## Notebook Overview
The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Library Imports**: Importing necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.
2. **Version Check**: Checking the versions of `scipy` and `scikit-learn`.
3. **Data Loading**: Loading the Iris dataset from a CSV file.
4. **Data Exploration**: Descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the dataset.
5. **Data Visualization**: Box plots, histograms, and scatter matrix to visualize the data.
6. **Data Splitting**: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
7. **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine.
8. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using cross-validation and comparing their performance.
9. **Final Model**: Training the final model using the Support Vector Machine and evaluating its performance on the validation set.

## Results
The notebook demonstrates that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved the highest accuracy on the validation set. The confusion matrix and classification report provide detailed insights into the model's performance.
